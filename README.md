# Task-1
Print all even numbers from 1 to 20, but with a step of 2. </br>
I solved this using three different functions for three different loops. Which are for loop, while loop, and do-while loop. </br>

# Task-2
Prints numbers from 1 to 50 using a for loop. And skip the iteration when the loop encounters a multiple of 5 then continue to the next iteration. </br>

# Task-3
Calculates and prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers without any function using a for loop. If a Fibonacci number is greater than 100, break out of the loop. </br>

# Task-4
Calculates and prints the first 15 numbers in the Fibonacci series by taking 15 as the argument of a function and using a for loop to generate these numbers and print them by calling the function. </br>
